# Wallet Audit

## Why does this exist?
I don't really like the mentality around "budgeting". I find that I never stick to the budget, and that makes me feel bad, but I've come to realize that my real intent when it comes to budgeting is just to have a better idea of where my spending goes by category. There aren't many tools out there that focus on this, so I created "Wallet Audit" to simplify my ability to inspect my personal finances.

This will be updated more as the project goes on.
